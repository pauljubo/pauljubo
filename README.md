### Hi there 👋
Currently learning programs such as HTML, CSS, and other various libraries.

For Assignment 3 in MULT 128, I decided to use Bootstrap for almost the entire layout of the website. I also decided to use Javascript and CSS libraries such as Animate on Scroll & Animate.css to enchance the pages more. Some pages would include Javascript while others would use CSS, this was done to make sach page unique and so they wouldn't feel bloated.
